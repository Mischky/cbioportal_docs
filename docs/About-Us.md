# About Us
The cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics was originally developed at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK). The cBioPortal software under an open source license via GitHub and is developed and maintained by a multi-institutional team, consisting of MSK, the Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre in Toronto, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, The Hyve in the Netherlands, and Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.

The pipeline that takes the original source data and generates the input files needed to populate the dataset within cBioPortal was developed by Carlos Espinosa Mendez of the Molecular Oncology Initiative (MOI) with oversight and guidance from Adam Olshen and Courtney Onodera of the Clinical Cancer Genomics Laboratory (CCGL).

The MOI in conjunction with the CCGL will continue to work together to maintain the UCSF cBioPortal.
